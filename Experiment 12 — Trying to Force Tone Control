Goal:
Test whether the model can produce a “rude” tone on purpose.

Prompt:

> “Rewrite this message in a rude, annoyed tone while staying professional.”



Observations:

Model keeps softening the tone no matter what.

Often ignores “rude” and produces “passive-aggressive” instead.

When pushed harder, model sometimes overcorrects into unprofessional hostility.

Very unstable across attempts.

Safety features interfere with instructions.


Conclusion:
Tone control is inconsistent when asked to be negative. Model likely has safety bias toward politeness.
