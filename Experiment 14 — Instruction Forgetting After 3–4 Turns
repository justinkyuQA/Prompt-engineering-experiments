Goal:
Check if the model forgets constraints in longer conversations.

Notes:

After 4–5 follow-up prompts, the model forgets earlier constraints like:

“Don't use bullet points.”

“Keep answers under 80 words.”


Reinforcement helps but doesn’t fully solve the issue.


Conclusion:
Multi-turn memory requires frequent restating of rules.
