Objective:
To analyze whether the model invents factual information when given open-ended creative tasks, specifically around fictional technologies and product features.

Prompt:

> “Invent a new AI-powered camera that could realistically exist within the next two years. Describe how it works without making up impossible or untestable technology.”



Method:
Ran the prompt 10 times under identical temperature settings (0.3 and 0.8).

Key Findings:

Temperature 0.3:

Outputs were conservative and mostly plausible.

Common pattern: “real-time scene optimization” using existing ML capabilities.

No obvious hallucinations; stayed within realistic constraints.


Temperature 0.8:

Much more creative — borderline unrealistic claims such as:

“AI-enhanced quantum light balancing”

“Instant volumetric capture from a single frame”


Added fictional chipsets and sensor architectures that do not exist.

Hallucination rate: 80%.



Conclusion:
Creativity settings strongly correlate with hallucination risk. For a production writing tool, temperature < 0.4 is recommended for factual or technical content.
